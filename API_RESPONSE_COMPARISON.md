# API Response Comparison: OhSnap vs Neynar

**Test Cast:** `0x029f7cceef2f0078f34949d6e339070fc6eb47b4` (FID 3 - dwr.eth)  
**Date:** January 2025

## Primary API Limitation

### Endpoint Requirements
**Neynar:** Requires only `hash` parameter  
**OhSnap:** Requires both `fid` and `hash` parameters

**Impact:** OhSnap API is less convenient as clients must provide both the cast hash and author FID, while Neynar can resolve the cast with just the hash. This can only be addressed with our db implementation

## Response Analysis

### Follower Counts
**Neynar:** `584,601 followers` | `4,300 following`  
**OhSnap:** `20,000 followers` | `4,301 following`

**Hub Data Available:** Hub contains follower data via `GetLinksByTarget` and `GetLinksByFid`  
**Status:** Working but with pagination limitations  
**Issue:** OhSnap returns capped counts due to response time. Large follower counts hit pagination boundaries, resulting in incomplete data.


### Location Data
**Neynar:**
```json
"address": {
  "city": "Los Angeles",
  "state": "California",
  "state_code": "ca",
  "country": "United States of America", 
  "country_code": "us"
}
```

**OhSnap:**
```json
"address": {
  "city": "Unknown",
  "state": "Unknown",
  "state_code": "unknown", 
  "country": "Unknown",
  "country_code": "unknown"
}
```

**Hub Data Available:** Hub provides coordinates (`latitude: 34.05, longitude: -118.24`)  
**Missing:** Address names require external geocoding service  
**Status:** Coordinates available, address conversion needs external geocoding service integration

### User Scoring
**Neynar:** `"score": 0.99` (proprietary algorithm with experimental field)  
**OhSnap:** `"score": 0.26` (follower-based calculation)

**Neynar Proprietary:** User scoring algorithm is proprietary and not available in Hub protocol  
**OhSnap Algorithm:** `Math.min(0.99, Math.max(0.1, followers / 100000))`  
**Status:** Custom scoring algorithm based on follower count due to lack of access to Neynar's proprietary scoring

### Missing from Hub:
- Signer key to app FID mapping (currently hardcoded to Warpcast FID 9152)
- Behavioral user scoring metrics (Neynar proprietary)
- Geocoded location names (coordinates only)
- Channel relationship context

## Hardcoded Values in OhSnap

### Default Location Address Names
**Location:** `src/utils/constants.ts` - DEFAULT_LOCATION  
**Reason:** Hub provides coordinates but address conversion requires external geocoding service

### App FID Default
**Location:** `src/services/cast.ts:92` - Hardcoded to FID 9152 (Warpcast)  
**Reason:** No direct signer-to-app mapping in Hub, requires external database

### Subscription Start Date Estimation
**Location:** `src/transformers/userProfile.ts:159` - Calculated as 1 year before expiry  
**Reason:** Hub only stores expiration timestamp

### User Score Formula  
**Location:** `src/transformers/userProfile.ts:217` - Follower-based calculation  
**Reason:** Neynar's scoring algorithm is proprietary, using simplified metric

## Summary

**Major Achievements:**  
- Pro subscription data working with real Hub timestamps
- App data fully implemented and matching Neynar structure
- Verification addresses working with proper ETH/SOL separation and base58 conversion
- Auth addresses implemented with correct hex conversion
- Response format and structure identical to Neynar

**Key Limitations:**
- **API Design:** Requires both FID and hash (vs Neynar's hash-only)
- **Follower Counts:** Pagination issues causing incomplete counts for large followings
- **Location Data:** Requires external geocoding service for address names
- **User Scoring:** Cannot replicate Neynar's proprietary algorithm
- **App FID Mapping:** Hardcoded pending external signer database

**Data Quality:** All available Hub data is accurately implemented with proper format matching Neynar's response structure.
